# "PS5 Hall Effect" Compatible Thumbstick Breakout Board
This breakout board is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the Sparkfun BOB-09110 but using hall effect thumbsticks instead of low quality "PS2 style" sticks.

These thumbstick components are widely available on Ali Express as replacement thumbsticks for game controllers. Unlike a traditional potentiometer based joystick, these sticks only operate with a specific polarity, so ensure you select one meant specifically for the PS5 to match the design of this board.

## Datasheet
I couldn't find a datasheet for these stick components, but the datasheet for [this alternative](https://mm.digikey.com/Volume0/opasdata/d220001/medias/docus/2608/THB001P%20drawing.pdf) stick seemed to have measurement information the exact same footprint, so it was used in the creation of this board.
